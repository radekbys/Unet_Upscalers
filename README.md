In this project I created a 2x upscaler inspited by u-net architecture.

I trained 10 models in total, until I developed a satisfying one.

I used the DIV2K dataset aviable at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joe1995/div2k-dataset/data?select=DIV2K_train_HR.

I used PyTorch for creating model and training, and OpenCV for manipulation of images.

Repository contains the final model code, trained final model, failed models, testing script with a preview, and two cowboys images for running the test script.

Data preparation and training code is collected in the data_preparation_and_training.ipynb notebook.
